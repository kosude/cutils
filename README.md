# cutils: C utility libraries

A modular set of lightweight, independent libraries to provide minimal, basic utility functions for C projects.

These libraries are developed for personal use so I don't recommend using them, as updates may be erratic. I am not affiliated with the C Standard,
any compilers, or other projects of a similar name.


## Further notes and manual

You can see the HTML web documentation manual for the C utility libraries at https://kosude.github.io/cutils.
