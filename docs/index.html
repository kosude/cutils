                <h2>Summary</h2>

                <p>
                    The C Utils Project, a.k.a. <code>cutils</code>, is a set of <b>modular, lightweight libraries</b> providing basic, common
                    utilities for C/C++ projects. I am a student and these libraries exist primarily for learning and personal use, not geared towards
                    production or professional use cases. In the name of good practice <i>(and for the small chance someone sees this in the future!)
                    </i> I am still putting effort into its documentation.

                    <br><br>

                    As an extra point, this project serves to replace and improve upon an older iteration, <code>zetaml</code>, which was more
                    specifically a maths library for graphics development.

                    <br><br>

                    The C Utils Project, cutils, is Free and Open Source Software, and the source repository can be found
                    <a href="https://github.com/kosude/cutils">here</a>. I am not affiliated with the C Standard, any compilers, or other projects of
                    a similar name.

                <h2>Libraries</h2>

                <p>
                    As mentioned earlier, the C Utils Project is not actually a library itself, but rather a collection of smaller libraries that can
                    be used independent of each other. These libraries are limited to the key features they aim to provide, and so they are
                    lightweight and normally simple to use. Some libraries are bigger than others!
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h3><a href="/cutils/clist">clist</a>: Linked list implementation</h3>

                        <p>
                            The clist library provides a basic doubly linked list structure, as well as a multitude of functions for using lists.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3><a href="/cutils/cio">cio</a>: Console input/output and logging functions</h3>

                        <p>
                            The cio library provides extra cross-platform utility functions for console output and log messages.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3><a href="/cutils/carray">carray</a>: Dynamic array implementation</h3>

                        <p>
                            The carray library provides an implementation of a dynamic array structure with a variety of extra operations.
                        </p>

                <h2>Compiling C Utility Libraries</h2>

                <p>
                    Libraries within the C Utils collection use <a href="https://cmake.org/">CMake</a> for building/compiling.

                    <br><br>

                    The command below compiles <b>all</b> utility libraries in release configuration:
                    <br><code>cmake . -B build/ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release</code>

                    <br><br>

                    Generally speaking, you do not need to compile the libraries in debug configuration unless you are contributing <i>(tysm ^^)</i>
                    or otherwise just want to compile test executables alongside them. On that note, to compile tests (using the GoogleTest
                    framework), build with debug configuration and the <code>-DCUTILS_TESTS=ON</code> flag. Note that <code>-Wall</code> + equivalents
                    are enabled when in debug mode, so all warnings are shown and they are treated as errors.

                    <br><br>

                    Individual utility libraries can be excluded from the build chain with individual compilation flags. They correspond to the
                    relevant library name; see the root <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> for specific option names. For example,
                    <code>-DCUTILS_CLIST=OFF</code> disables compiling the clist library. All libraries are compiled by default.
                </p>

                <h2>Compiling HTML documentation</h2>

                <p>
                    The documentation you're looking at right now is also compiled using CMake. It can be accessed through its deployment via
                    GitHub Pages, or compiled locally as part of the build pipeline. This manual does not use any automation tools like documentation
                    generators (e.g. Doxygen), just simple hand-typed HTML and CSS, as you can probably tell. However, some parts (like the header)
                    are templated for convenience, hence the need for CMake.

                    <br><br>

                    To build the documentation yourself, apply the <code>-DCUTILS_DOCS=ON</code> flag. This is not enabled by default!
                </p>

                <h2>Using this manual</h2>

                <p>
                    Within this documentation, information you should take note of is highlighted as such:
                </p>
				<span class="note">
					This is an example of a note.
				</span>
				<br>
				More important information is highlighted as a warning, like so:
				<span class="warning">
					This is an example of a warning.
				</span>

                <br>
