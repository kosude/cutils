                <p>
                    The C Utils library, a.k.a. <code>cutils</code>, is a set of <b>modular, lightweight libraries</b> providing basic, common utilities
                    for C/C++ projects. I am a student and these libraries exist primarily for learning and personal use, not geared towards production
                    or professional use cases. In the name of good practice <i>(and for the small chance someone sees this in the future!)</i> I am still
                    putting effort into its documentation.

                    <br><br>

                    As an extra point, this project serves to replace and improve upon one of my older endeavours, <code>zetaml</code>, which was more
                    specifically a maths library for graphics development.

                    <br><br>

                    The C Utils library, cutils, is Free and Open Source Software, and the source repository can be found
                    <a href="https://github.com/kosude/cutils">here</a>.
